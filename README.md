## 1.4 One-Line Pitch

`A real-time FPGA-accelerated Canny edge detection system using the PYNQ-Z2 board that processes live camera input and generates high-speed edge-enhanced output using DSP-based image processing.`

## 1.5 Expanded Project Idea

**Response:**  

`This project focuses on developing a real-time edge detection system using the PYNQ-Z2 FPGA platform to demonstrate high-speed hardware-accelerated image processing. The system captures live video input from a webcam and preprocesses the frames using Python and OpenCV inside a Jupyter Notebook environment. The grayscale image is then transferred to a custom FPGA IP core through AXI DMA, where edge detection is performed in real time using Sobel-based gradient computation and DSP48-accelerated convolution.`

`Unlike traditional CPU-based image processing, where pixels are processed sequentially, the FPGA processes multiple operations simultaneously using pipelining, streaming architectures, and dedicated DSP hardware blocks. The system uses line buffers, sliding convolution windows, Gaussian filtering, gradient magnitude approximation, and dual-threshold edge extraction to generate a continuous real-time edge-enhanced video output with very low latency.`

`By combining FPGA hardware acceleration with computer vision techniques, the project demonstrates how hardware/software co-design can improve image processing performance for real-time video processing, embedded systems, smart cameras, and basic computer vision applications.`

**Response:**

`This project combines a Canny-inspired edge detection pipeline with Canny-based gradient computation implemented entirely on FPGA using pure Verilog RTL and DSP48 hardware acceleration on the PYNQ-Z2 platform. The system uses AXI DMA, streaming architectures, pipelined processing, and dedicated DSP hardware blocks to achieve low-latency real-time edge detection from live webcam input, creating an optimized FPGA-based image processing pipeline without relying on high-level synthesis tools.`

# 3. Project Intent

## 3.1 User Journey

**Response:**

`The user starts the system using a Jupyter Notebook running on the PYNQ-Z2 board and connects a webcam for live video input. The webcam continuously captures video frames, and Python with OpenCV converts them into grayscale images before sending them to the FPGA through AXI DMA. Inside the FPGA, the custom Verilog edge detection IP processes the frames using Canny-inspired edge detection and DSP48-accelerated computation. The user can then observe the real-time edge-detected video output displayed live on the screen, where object boundaries and edges are highlighted continuously.`

---

# 4. Definition of Success

## 4.1 Definition of “Usable”

`In this project, the system is considered usable when the live image feed is captured and processed continuously without interruption, the FPGA correctly performs edge detection on incoming frames, and the output displays clear and stable edges in real time. Additionally, the data transfer through AXI DMA must operate reliably without crashes or delays, ensuring smooth and consistent overall performance.`

---

## 4.2 Minimum Usable Version

**Response:**

`The smallest version of this project that still delivers the core experience consists of a basic real-time pipeline where a laptop webcam captures live video, the image is converted to grayscale using Python and OpenCV, and the frames are transferred to the FPGA through AXI DMA. The FPGA then performs Canny-inspired edge detection using the custom Verilog RTL IP and returns the processed output, which is displayed on the screen in real time.`

# 17. Final Outcome

## 17.1 Final Description

**Response:**  

`The final version of the project is a real-time FPGA-based edge detection system implemented on the PYNQ-Z2 platform using Python/OpenCV preprocessing and a custom Verilog RTL accelerator. Live webcam frames are converted into grayscale images and transferred to the FPGA through AXI DMA, where Gaussian filtering and Canny-based edge detection using Sobel-based gradient computation are performed using DSP48 hardware blocks and streaming FPGA architecture. The processed edge-detected output is then displayed live with low latency, demonstrating real-time hardware-accelerated image processing using FPGA hardware/software co-design.`

---

## 17.2 What Works Well

**Response:**  

`The project successfully performs FPGA-based edge detection on live webcam input using AXI DMA communication and DSP48-accelerated Sobel processing. The custom Verilog RTL pipeline correctly performs Gaussian filtering, gradient computation, and threshold-based edge extraction in real time. The integration between Python/OpenCV preprocessing and FPGA hardware processing also worked reliably throughout testing and demonstration.`

---

## 17.3 What Still Needs Improvement

**Response:**  

`The Gaussian blur stage still requires optimization or reduction to preserve sharper edge details in the final output. The system also experiences slight processing delay during continuous real-time operation, which can be improved with further pipeline optimization.`

---

## 17.4 What Changed From the Original Plan

**Response:**  

`The original plan was to display the processed FPGA output on a separate monitor using HDMI output directly from the system. However, due to time constraints and the additional time required for debugging, the project was modified to display the real-time edge-detected output directly on the laptop screen using the current software-based display pipeline.`
